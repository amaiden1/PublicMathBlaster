# Team 04 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will meet up and discuss the what we believe to be fair assignments and when everyone agrees that the assignments are fair, then we will go with those assignments


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Continue to follow the deadlines established in our Gannt Chart 


## How will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will contact our group members through an established communication method (IE: slack, snapchat, etc.) and be honest with our difficulties


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Members that have finished their assigned tasks will be able to help the members that are having difficulties in order for us to stay on time.

## Punishments
- missing 3 meetings without 24 hours notice will result in a letter grade dropped on your peer review. 
- Failure to complete your assigned task on time will result in another letter grade docked, unless discussed with the team prior so that we can work together to try to complete the task in a timely manner.
